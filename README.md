The website interface for life teen's 2019 summer retreat, session 2 ARG (alternate reality game).

This interface was designed and conceputalized by my fellow leader, Jiggy, and myself for a session teaching teens about the ten commandments. The teens were given a tablet with this page loaded. This game involved multiple IRL activities followed by clues and tasks given by the website. Activities included an escape room, tallest tower building (with a twist!), and a calming origami break. 

Had time permitted, I would have loved to design this as an app, instead, so that the experience would have been more immersive. I would have tinkered around more with the design as well, and added a couple of interactive elements to the web design. As it happened, however, the bulk of the development happened a week before the retreat. This was due to a lot of idea changes surrounding the physical session. 

All in all,  the teens enjoyed the session thoroughly and were able to takeaway the main ideas of the activities, which, in my book, is a success!
