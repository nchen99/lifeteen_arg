                    In order to get back to reality, we need to build a beacon of sorts to communicate to people outside of this virtual realm.
                    It looks like we have only have a certain amount of materials to build this tower. Although, maybe we could improve on
                    other people's towers or use some of their materials? It wouldn't hurt, right?

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <strong>YOUR TASK:</strong> Build the tallest tower you can in the given time with the given materials! All the materials allotted to 
                    to your team can be found in front of you. No rules against using other team's materials. GO!
