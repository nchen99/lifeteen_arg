1. (on tablet, + instagram quotes) 
Jesus was human -- He too, had emotions like us. Even John writes so!

2. Commandments 

Order them correctly to open the last lock

3. Rosary
Before you're done, you must return to the beginning.


___ Our Father's, ____ Hail Mary's, _____ Glory Be's

SETUP OF ESCAPE ROOM + HOW TO SOLVE:

Setup: There will be instagram posts, a bible, and slips of money with misleading directions lying around the room, along with the two locked boxes

Step 1: hopefully the kids will put together the posts and the tablet hint (jesus crying, john, raising of lazarus) to get to John 11:35 (Jesus began to weep)
This will open the box with the commandments inside

Step 2: no clue, but the commandments. Kids will need to order the commandments correctly to get the direction combination for the lock.

Step 3: open last box, with rosary. Answer how many prayers you do at the beginning to get out! (1 our father, 3 hail mary's, 1 glory be)
